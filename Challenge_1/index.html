    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Anderson, a third year EE major from the Bay Area. Some of my hobbies include backpacking,
        hiking, and outboard canoeing!
        <br>
        In this class I am hoping to be able to really get deep into a product and develop something that 
        both interests me and will be something that I'm proud to show off
    </p>
