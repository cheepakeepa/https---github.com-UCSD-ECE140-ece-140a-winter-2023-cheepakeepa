    <blockquote>Feel better, move better, and recover faster</blockquote>
    <p>The Theragun is a massage gun which is designed to help people recover from muscle pains faster after exercise. Coming in a small form factor, with an even smaller theragun mini, it is extremely portable. While there exist competitors in the handheld massager market, theragun stands above the rest through their strong marketing and premium image.

    <h2>My Evaluation</h2>
    <P>While the Theragun is undoubtedly a very reliable product, one which fulfills its intended purpose with flying colors, I would not necessarily recommend it. The reputation it has as being top of it's class in the personal massage gun market is well deserved, 
        however it's performance may not necessarily warrant its price. The Theragun is priced at $400 while the Mini variant is priced at $150, whereas other comparable products can be found for around $80. While the Theragun does genearlly perform better than these competitors,
    it can't be said that it performs well enough to warrant a 5X price difference</P>
