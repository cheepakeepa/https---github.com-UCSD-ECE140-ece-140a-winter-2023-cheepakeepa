In Tutorial 1 I learned about the basic elements of HTML and how they incorporate into the layout of a webpage such as headers, paragraphs, spans and Divisions. I also learned organizational elements such as lists and tables as well as how to incorporate images and hyperlinks
The br tag is one which represents a line break, while the hr tag does the same while also placing a horizontal line to delineate this line break on the actual web page

In Tutorial 2 I learned about how to incorporate forms into an HTML page

In Tutorial 3 I learned about HTTP GET and POST requests, for example we created a GET route which displayed geisel library which was accesible by the route /library. Posting, which is necessary for users to send data to the server are necessary for the forms which I learned about in tutorial 2 to function, and then I learned about HTTP redirects which can be used to redirect the user to a different page after they submit their form for example

In Tutorial 4 I learned about how to use HTML forms to interact with the financialmodelingprep api which can be used to return detailed information about stocks. The data_json variable holds this datam and it is a json data type

## Challenge 1
The backend of Challenge 1 (App.py) works pretty simply, with the GET requests preparing for three different instances, a request of case_studies.html , schedule.html, and index.html When these GET requests, mainly through the use of the hyperlinks on the pages used to navigate around, the server returns an HTML response with the appropriate file
